## Generate Artist Names
Picking an artist name is hard! We can just delegate that task to a machine learning algorithm trained on prior data of artists. 
We will use Flask to serve the model and host it on a web server - heroku. 

This web server is hosted at - https://generate-djnames.herokuapp.com/

A description of the method is explained on my blog - https://ajeyvenkataraman.com/2022/02/01/generating-artist-names-using-deep-learning/
